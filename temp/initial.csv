The method is useful when we are going to develop an information system (IS) in the context of a given business. Understanding and resolving these concerns allow us to more easily gather the requirements for the new IS. Understanding the concerns means to be able to describe them. Therefore, for each concern a high level specification should be elaborated. This specification describes the concern associated problem and the care of one or more stakeholders. Taxonomy of concerns emerging during a IS life cycle is proposed by introducing four perspectives on the system development: social, informational, functional, and technological. From each of these perspectives concerns emerge that have to be taken in consideration in order to develop a new system or modify an existing one"","""",""0-7695-2690-X"",""0-7695-2690-X"",""10.1109/ICCGI.2006.70"",""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4124049"","""",""Advertising;Flow graphs;Information analysis;Information systems;Intelligent robots;Power engineering and energy;Raw materials;Software engineering;Software systems;Taxonomy"",""business data processing;formal specification;information systems;social aspects of automation"",""business stakeholder concern;concern-oriented analysis;enterprise information systems;functional perspective;high level specification;informational perspective;social perspective;system development;technological perspective"","""","""","""",""1"","""","""","""","""",""20070312"","""",""IEEE"","""",""IEEE Conference Publications"""
